That champion shall have the honor... 
No, no, the privilege to go forth and 
rescue the lovely princess Fiona from 
the fiery keep of the dragon. If for 
many reason the winner is unsucessful, 
the first runner up will take his place 
and so on and so forth. Some of you may 
die, but it's a sacrifice i am willing 
to make.
